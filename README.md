# TorchPrime

TorchPrime is a reference model implementation for PyTorch/XLA, designed to showcase best practices and efficient usage of PyTorch/XLA for high-performance machine learning on accelerators like TPUs.

## Features

- Optimized for PyTorch/XLA
- Demonstrates GSPMD parallelism
- Supports large language models tasks

## Requirements

- PyTorch
- PyTorch/XLA
- Transformers library
- Datasets library

## Usage [Placeholder]

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TorchPrime.git
   cd TorchPrime
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the training script:
   ```
   python trainer.py --model_id facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D --model_dimension 1
   ```

## Key Components [Placeholder]

- `trainer.py`: Main training script that sets up the model, data, and training loop
- `ModelArguments`: Dataclass for model-specific arguments
- SPMD and FSDP implementations for efficient distributed training
- Integration with Hugging Face's Transformers library for easy model and tokenizer loading
